# WoW Raid Notes
Raid notes for encounters in world of Warcraft from an Elemental Shaman perspective.

# Setup and Use
Right now this is used for primarily notes. You just need to setup git on your machine and then push from there. Depending on your machine there are different instructions not covered here. Special note you will need  [Git Credential Manger](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager) to authenticate with Github. On Windows I reccomend you install Git for Windows which will include this in the default setup.
