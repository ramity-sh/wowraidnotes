# General Notes on Playing MM Hunter in Retail focussed on Mythic Plus

1. You have access to hero through your "Ferocity Pet" via `Primal Rage`. To use it first summon your pet, start casting dismiss on your pet and when you are about to finish the cast press the hotkey for `Primal Rage`. This hotkey is tied to your pest specific ability, for MM this is `Fortitude of the Bear` which is `ctrl-space` for me.
