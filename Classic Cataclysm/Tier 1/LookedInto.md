# Looked Into
### Do we really need to lose our FE on Conclave of the Wind Heroic while we are on Anshal? [This Log says no, at least not always](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/PpMwAm3yn8BfT6kN#fight=30&type=damage-done&translate=true&source=64&target=432).
Seems like no but we either need to be on Rohash or we need to get lucky with spores not killing our FE. We could try to watch their health more but may just have to take the L here. 

### Watch video on Magma fight to see positioning tricks and confirm mechanics.
A: done and added details to notes.  

### For the start of Halfus what is the most efficient way to get my dragon freed and get to dpsing the boss?
Just click and move right away. Not rocket science.

### Stay in pool? - Nofication on Omnitron Fight? What is this and do you actually need to?
There is a buff pool(Power Generator) which is dropped by Arcanotron which you should stand in whenever possible.

### My new Merfin WAs appear to not be working. What can I do to test and make sure they are?
Needed to install the actual raid WAs not just the supporting ones.

### Should I use extended FE on Al'Akir? Is that viable given how the final part of the fight goes?
No, not worth it and the final phase doesn't last long enought to get a full use of him.

### When do I use my 2nd Volcanic Potion on all encounters?
Added to raid notes.

### On Maloriak when do the Vile Swills get killed so I can be ready?
As soon as they are spawned.

### Can I keep FE up on Ominitron Safely?
Yes!

### Make sure on fights where I don't pop my FE right after pull I am putting down my searing totem after the pull because it sometimes doesn't attack if you drop it pre-pull.
Done.

### How did [this guy](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/YD9k4CfvG3hpmjbc#fight=20&type=damage-done&source=14) get so many more CLs than [me](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/khtLzGTJpK6m2vqN#fight=27&type=damage-done&source=20).
They stack the adherants right on top of the boss which makes it easier to CL everything. This guy saved his EM for those times where he would spam CL to hit everyone with it when this was done. 

### Kifd question - On Chimaeron do we need to hold dps at the end to do the heals or when you said hold do you want to hold in place instead of spread?
Hold DPS.

### Determine strategy for running with orbs on Sinestra.
Run to the left but loop arround so that you will be back in frontish of the boss when it ends. Don't stop casting.

### Make sure FS WA is not covered by Merfin Auras
Done

### When to FE on Sinestra?
Ideally right before eggs start with trinket/potion pop.

### How to tell if you are hitting the shield on Omnotron?
Add `absorbedDamage > 0` to your log filter in raid damage and it will show. [Example](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/t6FGWZrgThKv9xaM#fight=5&type=damage-done&pins=2%24Off%24%23244F4B%24expression%24%5E2%24Off%24%23909049%24expression%24absorbedDamage%20%3E%200).

### Where is reincarnation icon with number in the middle coming from? Use `/framestack` command next raid to find out.
This seems to have solved itself. It is no longer showing up.

### Others have extra dragon (Slate) going on Halfus?
Seems to be a parse strat or maybe just alternative strat. Not going to worry about it too much since I'm making good progress but this will probably prevent my parses from going to high on this fight, the extra cleave would be huge.

###  Can I reduce duplicate notifications from WA and Bigwigs like Sinestra and the possible orb aggroers? Need my UI clean so I can see things clearer and not get distracted.

As far as I can tell there were no duplicate WAs or anything that was putting up notifications about possible orb aggroers. Is it possible that someone is sending notifications as a raid warning in the raid?

### Do I need to [add a WA](https://wago.io/tiDA_thSU) to see if my FT is attacking? 

Done, added this to my UI.

### What counts for parses is changing next week. I need to adjust talents.
   * Damage done to Twilight Whelps is removed on Sinestra
   * Damage done to Aberrations and Prime Subjects is removed on Maloriak
   * Only self-casted Unholy Frenzy will be allowed

I should probably not take the CL glyph on Sinestra any longer as the whelps don't matter for the parse. However it would be better for the raid if I did probably. 


### What is [Icy Reprisal](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/XyTMpPrnqCwNftKh#fight=20&type=damage-done&source=3) from [Heart of Ice](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=82665/heart-of-ice#comments) and how do I get it on me?

You can get this debuff by standing next to a player who gets Heart Of Ice on them.

From Wowhead
>Finally, Ignacious will apply the Heart of Ice debuff to a random player roughly every 20 seconds. Similarly to Ignacious's Burning Blood seen above, Heart of Ice deals 2k frost damage every 2 seconds, and an additional 2k fire damage with each subsequent tick for up to a minute. But it also grants the Frost Imbued buff to allies within a 10 yards radius with each tick, so you will want to pass the buff around to the whole raid as fast as possible before Dispelling it. With the Frost Imbued buff, every time you deal damage to Ignacious with any attack or ability, you inflict Icy Reprisal damage, adding 6-14k frost damage to all your attacks for the next 30 seconds.
