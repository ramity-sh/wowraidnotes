# Looked Into
### Do we really need to lose our FE on Conclave of the Wind Heroic while we are on Anshal? [This Log says no, at least not always](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/PpMwAm3yn8BfT6kN#fight=30&type=damage-done&translate=true&source=64&target=432).
Seems like no but we either need to be on Rohash or we need to get lucky with spores not killing our FE. We could try to watch their health more but may just have to take the L here. 

### Watch video on Magma fight to see positioning tricks and confirm mechanics.
A: done and added details to notes.  

### For the start of Halfus what is the most efficient way to get my dragon freed and get to dpsing the boss?
Just click and move right away. Not rocket science.

### Stay in pool? - Nofication on Omnitron Fight? What is this and do you actually need to?
There is a buff pool(Power Generator) which is dropped by Arcanotron which you should stand in whenever possible.
