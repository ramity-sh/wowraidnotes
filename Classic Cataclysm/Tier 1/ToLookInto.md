# Things to Look Into

1. Do we really need to lose our FE on Conclave of the Wind Heroic while we are on Anshal? [This Log says no, at least not always](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/PpMwAm3yn8BfT6kN#fight=30&type=damage-done&translate=true&source=64&target=432).

2. Should I use extended FE on Al'Akir? Is that viable given how the final part of the fight goes?

~~3. Watch video on Magma fight to see positioning tricks and confirm mechanics.~~
A: done and added details to notes.

4. Do I have a juicy SP max at another time in the fight besides the start where I could proc my FE? I would have to give up a mid fight potion for this though and potentially delay my prepot if it came up at the start.

5. For the start of Halfus what is the most efficient way to get my dragon freed and get to dpsing the boss?

6. For Theralion and Valiona I'm seeing a lot of logs like [this one](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TMy6wt1BKm84xL3N#fight=32&type=damage-done&source=16) where they are getting a lot more Lava Burst casts and procs than I am. What are they doing different?

7. Stay in pool? - Nofication on Omnitron Fight? What is this and do you actually need to?

9. Kifd question - On Chimaeron do we need to hold dps at the end to do the heals or when you said hold do you want to hold in place instead of spread?
