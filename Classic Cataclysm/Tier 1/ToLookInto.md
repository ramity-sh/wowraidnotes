# Things to Look Into

1. Do we really need to lose our FE on Conclave of the Wind Heroic while we are on Anshal? [This Log says no, at least not always](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/PpMwAm3yn8BfT6kN#fight=30&type=damage-done&translate=true&source=64&target=432).

2. Should I use extended FE on Al'Akir? Is that viable given how the final part of the fight goes?

3. Watch video on Magma fight to see positioning tricks and confirm mechanics.

4. Do I have a juicy SP max at another time in the fight besides the start where I could proc my FE? I would have to give up a mid fight potion for this though and potentially delay my prepot if it came up at the start.
