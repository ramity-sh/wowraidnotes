# Things to Look Into

1. Kifd question - On Chimaeron do we need to hold dps at the end to do the heals or when you said hold do you want to hold in place instead of spread?
1. For Theralion and Valiona I'm seeing a lot of logs like [this one](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TMy6wt1BKm84xL3N#fight=32&type=damage-done&source=16) where they are getting a lot more Lava Burst casts and procs than I am. What are they doing different?
1. On Maloriak when do the Vile Swills get killed so I can be ready?
1. Make sure on fights where I don't pop my FE right after pull I am putting down my searing totem after the pull because it sometimes doesn't attack if you drop it pre-pull.
1. Determine strategy for running with orbs on Sinestra.
1. Make sure FS WA is not covered by Merfin Auras
1. Can I keep FE up on Ominitron Safetely?
1. What is [Icy Reprisal](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/XyTMpPrnqCwNftKh#fight=20&type=damage-done&source=3) from [Heart of Ice](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=82665/heart-of-ice#comments) and how do I get it on me?
1. How did [this guy](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/YD9k4CfvG3hpmjbc#fight=20&type=damage-done&source=14) get so many more CLs than [me](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/khtLzGTJpK6m2vqN#fight=27&type=damage-done&source=20). - A: They stack the adherants right on top of the boss which makes it easier to CL everything. This guy saved his EM for those times where he would spam CL to hit everyone with it when this was done.
