# Things to Look Into

1. Kifd question - On Chimaeron do we need to hold dps at the end to do the heals or when you said hold do you want to hold in place instead of spread?

1. For Theralion and Valiona I'm seeing a lot of logs like [this one](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TMy6wt1BKm84xL3N#fight=32&type=damage-done&source=16) where they are getting a lot more Lava Burst casts and procs than I am. What are they doing different?

1. On Maloriak when do the Vile Swills get killed so I can be ready?
