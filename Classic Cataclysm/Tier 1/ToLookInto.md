# Things to Look Into

1. What is [Icy Reprisal](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/XyTMpPrnqCwNftKh#fight=20&type=damage-done&source=3) from [Heart of Ice](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=82665/heart-of-ice#comments) and how do I get it on me?

1. Others have extra dragon (Slate) going on Halfus?

1. Do I need to [add a WA](https://wago.io/tiDA_thSU) to see if my FT is attacking? 

1. Can I reduce duplicate notifications from WA and Bigwigs like Sinestra and the possible orb aggroers? Need my UI clean so I can see things clearer and not get distracted.

1. What counts for parses is changing next week. I need to adjust talents.
   * Damage done to Twilight Whelps is removed on Sinestra
   * Damage done to Aberrations and Prime Subjects is removed on Maloriak
   * Only self-casted Unholy Frenzy will be allowed
