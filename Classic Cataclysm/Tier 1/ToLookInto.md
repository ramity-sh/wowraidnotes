# Things to Look Into

1. Kifd question - On Chimaeron do we need to hold dps at the end to do the heals or when you said hold do you want to hold in place instead of spread?

1. When do I use my 2nd Volcanic Potion on all encounters?

1. My new Merfin WAs appear to not be working. What can I do to test and make sure they are?
1. Should I use extended FE on Al'Akir? Is that viable given how the final part of the fight goes?

1. For Theralion and Valiona I'm seeing a lot of logs like [this one](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TMy6wt1BKm84xL3N#fight=32&type=damage-done&source=16) where they are getting a lot more Lava Burst casts and procs than I am. What are they doing different?
