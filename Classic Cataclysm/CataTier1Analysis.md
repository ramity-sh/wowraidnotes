# Log Analysis

## Base Damage Difference?
1. I must be missing something key because this log shows hits with an average of 22.8k versus my 18.1
Theirs - https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/R6QGB2ZfHN4y3gqv#fight=6&type=damage-done&source=7
Mine - https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/hyaB1KPvTt2YzCVQ#fight=4&type=damage-done&source=15

Looks like the fight time is quite different though so that could easily account for some of it.
