# General Summary
In general did better than last week but still made some errors on a few fights. 

Low Damage? Looking at my parses it feels like I do really poor damage, however on Beth, Rhy, and Alysrazor I am killing adds not the boss so my parse will never look good on those fights and thanks to FE knocking boulders back I loose him in Rag for a good chunk of the fight.

## Shannox
* Need to make sure I am near the traps and can trap when needed. Don't think I specifically missed this but someone did and it caused us to wipe.
* Forgot my prepot on opener.

## Bethilac
* Try to make sure I am constantly targetting the correct spiders for chain lightning. 
* I did a better job staying alive this fight than last week but also got better heals.

## Rhyolith - Errors
* 2nd pot was weak.
* Died due to immolation and eruption, stood next to a volcano and then stayed close to the adds

## Alysrazor - Errors
* Died to tornadoes - I need to review some videos and practice on Retail if possible to figure out a safe way to do this. Right now I die 50% of the time. Correct camera angle is part of it, I solved that this week but ended up in a spot where I jooked right (into a tornado) instead of left.

## Baleroc
* No mistakes here, covered well when the rotation for crystals got
messed up.

## MajorDomo
* Missed my 2nd pot

## Ragnaros
* No issues
