# General Summary
Did ok this week but those tornadoes... Honestly I froze up when they came out and didn't follow my plan. Need to find way to practice this mechanic. 

## System Performance
I noticed my game seemed to lag some throughout the whole raid. My ping and fps was stable but it felt like there were frame drops or I would perform actions such as casting but not see the results. Will need to look into this some more. 

*Think that I was seeing lag here because I noticed the same thing while playing dungeons throughout the week. Restarting my router/modem and computer seems to have done the trick.*

## Merfin only - No bigwigs

This worked but only because I know most of the mechanics. Merfin is straight up giving me wrong timings on many bosses. I will try Fojji next week. Maybe the new versions of Merfin I downloaded contributed to the system performance issues I saw? Not sure, can't reproduce either unless I'm in a raid. Will try running some battle grounds to see if I can replicate the issue.

*Merfin was buggy so I've moved back to Fojji*
