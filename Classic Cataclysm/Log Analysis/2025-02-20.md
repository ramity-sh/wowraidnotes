# General Summary
Did ok but was a bit of a crazy run due to the guild being roudy. 

## System Performance
No issues!

## Comparison vs Biff
Was good to have another elemental in the raid to compare against. In general Biff parsed higher than I did, it looks like int somehow seems to fluctuate quite a bit. I don't know if it is worth looking at stats...

| Fight | Biff Int | Ramity Int |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Rhyolith | 7095 | 6538 |
| Alysrazor| 7095 | 6538 |
| Shannox | 7095 | 7861 |
| Baleroc | 8418 | 7861 |
| Beth'tilac | 7095 | 6538 |
| MajorDomo | 8418 | 7861 |
| Rag | 8418 | 7861 |

I also noticed his LBs and LB hit more than mine did. This could be due to crits? Need to look at it some more.
