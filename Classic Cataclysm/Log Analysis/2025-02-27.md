# First kills of Zon'ozz, Hagara, Ultraxion
Some fights where better than others. I made some avoidable errors on each fight.
## Things to Consider

### Observations

### Actions
1. Modify button for Ultraxion so I don't have to hit shift. Also make sure it is a stop casting macro so I can cancel a cast at just the right time.

2. Think more about planning dps routes while moving so I'm constantly casting and reducing any potential time spent traveling but not dpsing.

### Fight Specific

#### Zon'ozz
I did pretty good on this fight overall, lots of interupts. Could probably tighten up my pathing on adds to make sure I am in a good position as we kill tentacles to avoid downtime against the boss. Also use my move while casting cd. 

#### Hagara
I was stuck in every ice tomb in this fight, incredibly unlucky. Need to plan out my route to make sure I can effectively keep hitting the target whether that is the boss, the add, or the pylons depending on the phase.

#### Ultraxion 
Here I could get greedier on the pressing of the button. I need to make the button a just click instead of a shift-modified selection.

#### Blackhorn (wipes)
Watch for purple swirly clouds... -_-
