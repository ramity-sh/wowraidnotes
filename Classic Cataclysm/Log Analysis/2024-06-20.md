## Things to Consider
Overall I showed some improvements from [Night 1](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/bnL63RPVGjZ7CqaH) and [Night 2](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/H1Rmdj2Ggz8AqQBc). Not nearly as much as I would like though. My i-level parse from this week, [day 1}(https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/khtLzGTJpK6m2vqN) and [day 2](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/qmrDZjyvWc674B1A#view=rankings&boss=-2&difficulty=0&wipes=2) was about the same but I made less mechanical failures. 

### Observations
1. Watch my Flameshock, I seem to be letting it drop still when it shouldn't. 

### Actions
1. Need to Adjust my ui so my FS WA is not covered by new Merfin Auras
1. Determine when Vile Swills come out and be ready to blast.


### Fight Specific
#### Magma
- Make sure you are always casting and don't let Your flameshock die on Magma.
- Chain Lightning should almost ALWAYS be used instead of Lightning bolt. 
- Use your Earth shock when it is up even when you are casting CL on both the boss and the add. 

#### Omnitron
- Need to see if I can keep my FE up without him popping the shield
- Watch for poison bombs, you should be hitting these ever time they pop.

#### Chimaeron
- Had to Stop DPS on this fight which really hurt my parse.
- Missed 2nd pot on this fight

#### Atramedes
- FE stopped attacking and I didn't get my Searing totem up right away.

#### Maloriak
- Need to determine when Vile Swills come out and be ready to blast on them. 

#### Halfus
- Missed switching glyph which reduced my CL damage.
- Missed Prepot, should pre pot and start my dragon to line up better with the pull.
- Need to drop FE right next to where Halfus is.

#### Theralion and Valiona
- Not enough Chain Lightning but I need the tank to keep the dragon underneath the other one for more of the fight.

#### Ascendant Council
- Prio Lava Burst more seems like there is such a thing as too much CL?
- Lead with FE
- What is [Icy Reprisal](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/XyTMpPrnqCwNftKh#fight=20&type=damage-done&source=3) from [Heart of Ice](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=82665/heart-of-ice#comments) and how do I get it on me? 
- Missed my 2nd Potion

#### Cho'gall
- Fire Elemental Totem glpyh may be worth it here.
- How did [this guy](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/YD9k4CfvG3hpmjbc#fight=20&type=damage-done&source=14) get so many more CLs than [me](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/khtLzGTJpK6m2vqN#fight=27&type=damage-done&source=20).

#### Sinestra
- Follow whelps while casting, then go directly to your egg spot, hard dps on Sinestra and blast your egg.
- FE, wait until after the egg phase to get your FE out. 
- Terrible handling of orb tether.

#### Nefarion 
- Breaking out of MC, how far is too far to let it go?
- What to do if you have time left on your debuff and get mc'd again?
- Searing Totem was in a bad spot for a good minute.

#### Conclave
- Searing totem was in a bad spot for most of this encounter.
- Watch your feet so you are in range and don't stop dpsing at any time.

#### Al'Akir
- Lots of CL damage on the higher parses, which I can do if I'm allowed to cleave...
- Watch your Searing totem placement.   
- Don't forget your 2nd volcanic potion
