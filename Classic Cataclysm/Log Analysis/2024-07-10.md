### Things to Consider
I got a lot of gear in this raid so next raid (7/17) I should see an increase in my damage. No more execuses for bad damage. :)


### Observations
1. For logs on Magma the lava parasites count as nothing but if you are missing a hunter you will need to dps them.

2. On Omnitron my damage to poison bombs was not as good as it could have been. Too much downtime due to switching targets too many times. Make sure you are timing your casts and only moving when necessary.

3. Need to make sure I get to the group quick if I have the Meteorite on Theralion and Valiona.
