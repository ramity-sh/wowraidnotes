## Things to Consider
My parses are better(Still not good) since I now have better gear however my parse by bracket shows there is still a lot of room for improvement. I'm targeting to hit an average in the 80s for my best parses ASAP.

### Observations
I had a few avoidable deaths, these should be deep dived:

1. [Maloriak](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/NR7y1rYbz62p3GWQ#source=1&type=deaths&fight=12&death=1)
1. [Theralion and Valiona](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/NR7y1rYbz62p3GWQ#source=1&type=deaths&fight=28)
1. [Ascendant Council](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/NR7y1rYbz62p3GWQ#source=1&type=deaths&fight=32) (Maybe?) 
1. [Sinestra](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/NR7y1rYbz62p3GWQ#source=1&type=deaths&fight=39) - Slicer on one of our wipes, big contribution to the raid wiping.
