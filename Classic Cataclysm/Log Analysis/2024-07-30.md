# Things to Consider
For Al'Akir I need to get some new keybinds to move up and down so I can continue casting while moving in an easier way.

In general my parses have improved and it won't do me too much good I feel to spend too much time critiquing fights that I'm doing solid in (average 75 - 80 parse). 

The fights I want to focus on are:

1. Omnotron
2. Ascendant Council
3. Theralion and Valiona
4. Sinestra

The others I can still improve/reduce errors on but these four I feel least comfortable with.
