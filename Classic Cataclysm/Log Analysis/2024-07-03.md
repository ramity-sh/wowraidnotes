## Things to Consider
Much [better night](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/compare/t6FGWZrgThKv9xaM/self#type=damage-done&boss=-3&difficulty=0) overall but still more to improve upon. 

### Observations
1. Still need to work on making sure I get my 2nd potion in. 
2. Unfortunate that I was unable to switch glyphs until I realized my "AddonSkins" for Elvui was disabled. 
3. On halfus I need to stay targetted on him and let my cleave kill the dragons. Keep FS up on him and do LB on CD, otherwise CL. Ignore ES.
