# Final Prog Week Analysis
I do seem to just hit with less damage for every cast, should i get more mastery? The sims say no but
hmmm...

- I need to wait for 9 stacks on Fulmination charges instead of 7.
- Don't use `/cqs` macros unless you are hitting your cds.

## Morchock
- Had the wrong glyph for CL, need to not have it equipped.
- Make sure you CL when they are close together and use your movement while casting.

## Zon'ozz
- Bad CD usage. Make sure you are in a good spot before you start blasting your CDs.
- Watch rotation, maintain it even if you are on the adds. Use your boots when you need to to get to casting faster.


## Yor'sahj
- Had wrong glyph for CL, need to have it equipped to hit 4 targets.

## Hagara
- I was ice trapped, killed the parse

## Ultraxion
- Here I think my two big findings are having a large impact on my dps and it shows in the patchwerk fight. I'm not getting as many casts off as I should of lightning bolt in general.
