# General Summary
Post raid I felt like this was one of my worst raids in a while. Will do a recap here to find areas to improve. 

## Beth'tilac
I was responsible for soaking spiders on this fight with Kielta. I died twice as did
Kielta. Healing wise it seems like I didn't get as much as I needed, I was the [top healer for myself](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/YBHRbfLhwrDgTa43?fight=9&type=healing&start=1633281&end=1804254&target=3).

My first death took place over 51 seconds so on that one I could use more heals. Second one I did take a volatile burst when I shouldn't have. I need to make sure I can take a hit before doing so.

Also I need to make sure I'm focusing on killing the *Cinderweb Spiderlings* primarily on this fight with chain lightning.

## Shannox
Try to stay closer to traps in case things go bad, other than that no changes needed. 

## Rhyolith
I forgot my second pot (Did this on a lot of fights actually)

## Alysrazor
Absolutely embarassing that I got hit by the flame jet. Pay attention.

## Baleroc
Only fight with no major mistakes? Still forgot the 2nd pot.

## Majordomo
Forgot the 2nd pot at the end.

## Rag
This fight I did ok on most attempts. Did mis hit or fail to hit a Son with my lightning push pack.
