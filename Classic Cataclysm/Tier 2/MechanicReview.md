# Overall Notes on Performance

1. Deaths to Tornadoes on Alysrazor. 

This is a totally fair call out. I don't know the exact metrics but feel like I fail this mechanic 49% of the time. I have had a fundamental misunderstanding of how the mechanic worked and how to work around it. In hindsight very obvious but over the course of the tier I underestimated how much I understood it. Now that I've watched some videos on it I've got it, basically just need to follow a tornado every time it passes. The only awkward part is the beginning where tornados are first spawning, how to position myself so I don't get hit by them as they are spawning. Any ideas there would be appreciated.

2. Fire Dance Deaths on Rag. (Engulfing Flames)

This one I need some help understanding the issue. I've died twice ever to missing the dance, once on my first time killing rag and once on Jan 1. I know last week I just got greedy and misjudged how far I needed to move to be on just the inside the safe area. 

I looked through the logs of 6 total times I've killed Rag. Here's the stats on deaths, I've bolded the ones I could have prevented.

Nov 20th (My first rag)
Attempt 1 - Death during group wipe
*Attempt 2 - Death by Molten Elemental*
Attempt 3 - Death during group wipe

Attempt 5 - [Death with 4 others by Lava wave at 9 mins in?](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/gRzcmyAXN7CBPwLq?fight=81&type=deaths) looks like a group wipe.
