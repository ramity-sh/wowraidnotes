# Dragon Soul 
Look Into:

## Morchok / Kochrom
Hero most likely at 20% as he hits hard.
### Phase 1
* Two boses with equal mechanics in this fight.
* Boss casts stomp every 15 seconds, this is a stack attack, stay within 25 yards of the boss.
* Boss throws out crystal which will target 7 closest players shooting damage toward them. There are three tiers of damage depending on how close you are to the crystal. Players should rush to the crystal then change from Red(too close) to Blue(far enough away to be in range but not dieing from the crystal).

### Phase 3
* Bosses such players in and then throw a bunch of spikes out. Get behind spikes to avoid the "Black Blood" the boss puts out.

## Yor'sahj the Unsleeping 
* Use CL Glyph
* Hero may be used for the number 

### Boss ino
* Kill adds that spawn but only the one you are supposed to kill. 
* Stack for most combiniations. 
* Spread when called out to spread on combo 6. (pers/hs here), get close to void right before it dies after a green bolt goes out.
* Combo 4 is probably when we will use hero due to lots of damage.
